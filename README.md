Following the concept of the popular question cards people play at parties to get to know each other.

Using React Hooks, mapping questions from an array to display on each button click (previous/next question). Using props and destructuring, could use useContext to resolve any prop drilling pattern. Added event listeners for keydown presses inside useEffect, together with clean up function. Proptypes is used in place of Typescript.

Also learned that state is asynchronous thus console logs of the state will not be up to date with the real state.

Styling has room for improvement.
