Following the concept of the popular question cards people play at parties to get to know each other.

Using React Hooks, mapping questions from a const array to display on each button click (previous/next question). Using props and destructuring, mainly to display my awareness of the concepts. Proptypes is used in place of Typescript.

Also learned that state is asynchronous thus console logs of the state will not be up to date with the real state.

Styling has room for improvement. Going to add event listeners to enable keydown press for arrow keys, just going to solve a bug related to it first.
